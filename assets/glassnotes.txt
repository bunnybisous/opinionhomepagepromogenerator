Jeremy Zilar:
	Do you know what the endpoint is for Glass to return a list of all stories from a section?
Lacy Garrison:
	it can do that?!
Jeremy Zilar:
	Save this: http://glass-output.prd.use1.nytimes.com/glass/outputmanager/v1/mobileSectionFront.json?topLevelAssetTypes[]=article&topLevelAssetTypes[]=blogpost&url[]=http://www.nytimes.com/pages/index.html
Lacy Garrison:
	thanks
Jeremy Zilar:
	Also, here are ALL the sections: http://cms-service.prd.nytimes.com/resources/v2/section.json?size=500
	all 427
	Luke asked that if we use that list, that we make a copy and not hit it directly.
